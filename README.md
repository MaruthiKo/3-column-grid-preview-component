## My process
I started with semantic HTML, after building out the total HTML of the challenge. I added basic css-reset and typography. 
I started the solution with mobile-first approach. I used grid to make a 1column layout for mobile and used flexbox with a column direction. 
After completing the mobile design, I started with the desktop design which consisted everything same as mobile except that I made it a 3column layout as the design suggested  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Just before starting out this project I have read and completed the theoritical part of CSS-grid and media queries.
This project helped me in using both of them and this helped me learn the practical approach to my learning. I learned the way of mobile approach first while designing a mobile-responsive layout. I also learned how to center the whole content using flexbox. 


```html
<h1>This is how I centered my content</h1>
```

```css
main{
    display: flex;
    min-height: 95vh;
    justify-content: center;
    align-content: center;
}
```
